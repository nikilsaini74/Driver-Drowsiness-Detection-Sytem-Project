# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Project

### Description:
Welcome to the Driver Drowsiness Detection System project repository! This project aims to improve road safety by developing an advanced system that detects drowsiness in drivers and alerts them in real-time. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, our system ensures that drivers stay attentive and focused while on the road, thereby reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.

### Contents:
1) /data: This directory contains the sample dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
2) /haar_cascades: Haar cascades XML files used for facial feature detection.
3) /model: Trained machine learning models for drowsiness detection.
4) /one-time-model-check: A folder that contains images for a one-time check of the model's performance.
5) /notebooks: This directory contains two Jupyter notebooks:
    main.ipynb: A comprehensive notebook with step-by-step instructions on how to run the drowsiness detection system.
    model.ipynb: A detailed notebook showcasing the model training process and evaluation.
6) alarm.wav: An audio file for the alert sound played when drowsiness is detected.

### Key Features:
1) Computer Vision-based Drowsiness Detection: The system employs computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's facial features, analyze eye movements, and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time.
2) Machine Learning Algorithms: We have integrated powerful machine learning algorithms to process facial data efficiently and accurately identify drowsiness patterns.
3) Real-time Alert System: The system triggers timely audio and visual alerts to the driver when drowsiness is detected, ensuring quick response and prevention of potential accidents.
4) Customizable Thresholds: The drowsiness detection thresholds are customizable, allowing for adaptation to individual driver preferences and varying road conditions.
5) Efficient Performance: Our system is optimized for real-time performance, making it suitable for deployment on various hardware platforms, including embedded systems.
